A struct's or struct-like enum variant's field was not provided.
Erroneous code example:
```rust
struct Foo {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let x = Foo { x: 0 }; // error: missing field: `y`
}
```
Each field should be specified exactly once. Example:
```rust
struct Foo {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let x = Foo { x: 0, y: 0 }; // ok!
}
```
