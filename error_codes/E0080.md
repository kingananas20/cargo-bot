A constant value failed to get evaluated.
Erroneous code example:
```rust
enum Enum {
    X = (1 << 500),
    Y = (1 / 0),
}
```
This error indicates that the compiler was unable to sensibly evaluate a
constant expression that had to be evaluated. Attempting to divide by 0
or causing an integer overflow are two ways to induce this error.
Ensure that the expressions given can be evaluated as the desired integer type.
See the [Discriminants](<https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/enumerations.html#discriminants>) section of the Reference for more information about
setting custom integer types on enums using the
[`repr` attribute](<https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/type-layout.html#representations>).
